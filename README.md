audio production modules for porteus linux
==========
i am only not deleting this in case somebody needs it someday and can't find anything more better-er (which probably won't happen)

I was possesed by a masochistic urge to create a linux distribution based off of Slackware, and changed my mind and based it off of UB-dCore, a hybrid of Tiny Core Linux and Ubuntu. I don't remember what  version of Porteus these were on, somewhere around the major Slackware Linux release that happened in 2014
